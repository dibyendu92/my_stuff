# my_stuff
I made this to put my random codes.
Most of them would be written in python2.7 or higher.
Most of them would be written to help my projects at USC 

HOW to run rmsd_calc.py:
./rmsd_calc.py molecule_1.pdb molecule_2.py NO (for residue to residue rmsd). Or, 
./rmsd_calc.py molecule_1.pdb molecule_2.py FULL (for overall rmsd calculation)
IT CAN also do COM (center of mass) calculation.
